# opencode-a2a-server

> Turn OpenCode into a stateful A2A service with a clear runtime boundary.

`opencode-a2a-server` exposes OpenCode through standard A2A interfaces and adds
the runtime pieces that raw agent runtimes usually do not provide by default:
authentication, session continuity, streaming contracts, interrupt handling,
and explicit security guidance.

## Why This Project Exists

OpenCode is useful as an interactive runtime, but applications and gateways
need a stable service layer around it. This repository provides that layer by:

- bridging A2A transport contracts to OpenCode session/message/event APIs
- making session and interrupt behavior explicit and auditable
- keeping the server/runtime contract explicit while leaving deployment
  supervision to the operator

## What It Already Provides

- A2A HTTP+JSON endpoints (`/v1/message:send`, `/v1/message:stream`,
  `GET /v1/tasks/{task_id}:subscribe`)
- A2A JSON-RPC endpoint (`POST /`) for standard methods and OpenCode-oriented
  extensions
- SSE streaming with normalized `text`, `reasoning`, and `tool_call` blocks
- session continuation via `metadata.shared.session.id`
- request-scoped model selection via `metadata.shared.model`
- OpenCode session query/control extensions and provider/model discovery
- released CLI install/upgrade flow and a foreground runtime entrypoint

## Extension Capability Overview

The Agent Card declares six extension URIs. Shared contracts are intended for
any compatible consumer; OpenCode-specific contracts stay provider-scoped even
though they are exposed through A2A JSON-RPC.

| Extension URI | Scope | Primary use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `urn:a2a:session-binding/v1` | Shared | Bind a main chat request to an existing upstream session via `metadata.shared.session.id` |
| `urn:a2a:model-selection/v1` | Shared | Override the default upstream model for one main chat request |
| `urn:a2a:stream-hints/v1` | Shared | Advertise canonical stream metadata for blocks, usage, interrupts, and session hints |
| `urn:opencode-a2a:session-query/v1` | OpenCode-specific | Query external sessions and invoke OpenCode session control methods |
| `urn:opencode-a2a:provider-discovery/v1` | OpenCode-specific | Discover normalized OpenCode provider/model summaries |
| `urn:a2a:interactive-interrupt/v1` | Shared | Reply to interrupt callbacks observed from stream metadata |

## Design Principle

One `OpenCode + opencode-a2a-server` instance pair is treated as a
single-tenant trust boundary.

This repository's intended scaling model is parameterized self-deployment:
consumers should launch their own isolated instance pairs instead of sharing
one runtime across mutually untrusted tenants.

- OpenCode may manage multiple projects/directories, but one deployed instance
  is not a secure multi-tenant runtime.
- Shared-instance identity/session checks are best-effort coordination, not
  hard tenant isolation.
- For mutually untrusted tenants, deploy separate instance pairs with isolated
  Linux users or containers, isolated workspace roots, isolated credentials,
  and distinct runtime ports.

## Logical Components

```mermaid

    Hub["A2A client / a2a-client-hub / app"] --> Api["opencode-a2a-server transport"]
    Api --> Mapping["Task / session / interrupt mapping"]
    Mapping --> Runtime["OpenCode HTTP runtime"]

    Api --> Auth["Bearer auth + request logging controls"]
    Runtime --> Workspace["Shared workspace / environment boundary"]
```

This repository wraps OpenCode in a service layer. It does not change OpenCode
into a hard multi-tenant isolation platform.

## Recommended Client Side

If you need a client-side integration layer to consume this service, prefer
[a2a-client-hub](https://github.com/liujuanjuan1984/a2a-client-hub).

It is a better place for client concerns such as A2A consumption, upstream
adapter normalization, and application-facing integration, while
`opencode-a2a-server` stays focused on the server/runtime boundary around
OpenCode.

## Security Model

This project improves the service boundary around OpenCode, but it is not a
hard multi-tenant isolation layer.

- `A2A_BEARER_TOKEN` protects the A2A surface, but it is not a tenant
  isolation boundary inside one deployed instance.
- LLM provider keys are consumed by the OpenCode process. Prompt injection or
  indirect exfiltration attempts may still expose sensitive values.
- Deployment supervision is intentionally BYO. If you wrap this runtime with
  `systemd`, Docker, Kubernetes, or another supervisor, you own the service
  user, secret storage, restart policy, and hardening choices.

## User Paths

Released versions are published to PyPI and mapped to Git tags / GitHub
Releases. This is the recommended entry point for users.

### Path 1: Run a Released CLI in an Existing User Environment

Install the latest release:

```bash
uv tool install opencode-a2a-server
```

Upgrade an existing installation:

```bash
uv tool upgrade opencode-a2a-server
```

Install an exact release:

```bash
uv tool install "opencode-a2a-server==<version>"
```

Run it against an existing project/workspace:

```bash
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=<your-key> \
OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ID=google \
OPENCODE_MODEL_ID=gemini-3.1-pro-preview \
opencode serve

A2A_BEARER_TOKEN=prod-token \
A2A_PUBLIC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/abs/path/to/workspace \
opencode-a2a-server serve
```

`OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is the default workspace root that this runtime
exposes to OpenCode.

Default address: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

Common runtime variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A2A_BEARER_TOKEN` | Yes | None | Bearer token required for authenticated runtime requests. |
| `OPENCODE_BASE_URL` | No | `http://127.0.0.1:4096` | Upstream OpenCode HTTP endpoint. |
| `OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ROOT` | No | None | Default workspace root exposed to OpenCode. |
| `OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ID` | No | None | Default provider for the upstream runtime. |
| `OPENCODE_MODEL_ID` | No | None | Default model for the upstream runtime. Set together with `OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ID`. |
| `A2A_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Bind host for the A2A server. |
| `A2A_PORT` | No | `8000` | Bind port for the A2A server. |
| `A2A_PUBLIC_URL` | No | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Public base URL advertised by the Agent Card. |
| `A2A_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `WARNING` | Server log level. |
| `A2A_LOG_PAYLOADS` | No | `false` | Enable request/response payload logging. |
| `A2A_LOG_BODY_LIMIT` | No | `0` | Payload preview size used when payload logging is enabled. |
| `A2A_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` | No | `1048576` | Maximum accepted request size. |
| `A2A_ALLOW_DIRECTORY_OVERRIDE` | No | `true` | Allow request-level `metadata.opencode.directory` overrides. |
| `A2A_ENABLE_SESSION_SHELL` | No | `false` | Enable high-risk `opencode.sessions.shell`. |
| `OPENCODE_TIMEOUT` | No | `120` | Upstream OpenCode request timeout in seconds. |
| `OPENCODE_TIMEOUT_STREAM` | No | None | Upstream OpenCode stream timeout override in seconds. |

If you omit `OPENCODE_PROVIDER_ID` / `OPENCODE_MODEL_ID`, `opencode serve`
uses your local OpenCode defaults (for example `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`).

For provider-specific auth, model IDs, and config details, use the OpenCode
official docs and CLI:

- Providers: <https://opencode.ai/docs/providers/>
- Models: <https://opencode.ai/docs/models/>
- Local checks: `opencode auth list`, `opencode models`, `opencode models <provider>`

This path is for users who already manage their own shell, workspace, and
process lifecycle.

Use any supervisor you prefer for long-running operation:

- `systemd`
- Docker / container runtimes
- Kubernetes
- `supervisord`, `pm2`, or similar process managers

The project no longer ships built-in host bootstrap or process-manager
wrappers. The official product surface is the runtime entrypoint itself.

Minimal `systemd` example:

1. Create an env file such as `/etc/opencode-a2a/alpha.env`:

```bash
A2A_BEARER_TOKEN=replace-me
A2A_HOST=127.0.0.1
A2A_PORT=8000
A2A_PUBLIC_URL=https://a2a.example.com
OPENCODE_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4096
OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/srv/my-workspace
```

2. Create a unit file such as `/etc/systemd/system/opencode-a2a-server.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=OpenCode A2A Server
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/srv/my-workspace
EnvironmentFile=/etc/opencode-a2a/alpha.env
ExecStart=/home/dev/.local/bin/opencode-a2a-server serve
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `ExecStart` with the absolute path returned by `command -v opencode-a2a-server`.

Migration notes:

- `OPENCODE_DIRECTORY` has been removed. Use `OPENCODE_WORKSPACE_ROOT`.
- Built-in `init-release-system`, `deploy-release`, and `uninstall-instance` have been removed.
- Secret storage, service users, restart policy, and supervisor configuration are now operator-managed.
